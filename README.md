# Memory Game

## Built and maintained by: Chris Zeigler

A fun little React game. Click on the pictures to have a point added to your Score. When a picture is clicked, the images will shuffle around. Click on a different image to add another point to your Score. If you click on an image that you have already clicked on, then the game is over. Try and get a high score!

### Tools Used

I built this game using: 

* React
* Express/Node
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* VS Code 



I would also like to give credit to using Richard Durstenfeld's shuffle algorithm that I used to rearrange the pictures.
